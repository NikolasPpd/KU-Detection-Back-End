# How to Run

Follow the steps below to run the project:

1. Ensure that Git is installed on your local machine. If not, you can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Install the necessary Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory.
3. Rename the file `temp.run.py` to `run.py`.
4. Open `run.py` and locate the line `repo_path = "path/to/repo"`.
5. Replace `"path/to/repo"` with the local path of the repository you want to analyze.
6. Save the changes and run `run.py`.

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read the repository and write to the output directory.
